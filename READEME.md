# Post Install Documentation
The following is an attempt at documenting my process and categorizing some of the installation choices I typically make.

## Table of Contents
I imagine this is going to get large
- TOC
- Foundational
- Essentials
- Additional packages

## Foundational
This includes the very most basic tools commonly installed, in case your OS is staring from  a very minimal installation
This should also include 

Install the following:
- wsl (if windows)
- curl / wget (depending on what is already on here)
- vim
- ssh access to github

## Essentials
These are some basic things that I like to have on all my machines like my dotfiles
- chezmoi


## Additional packages based on OS use

### Entertainment
Video Game managers like Steam. Epic, etc... Also includes Spotify, iTunes (if MacOS), VLC

### Creativity suite
Ranging from creative design tools like Gimp, Photoshop, to video tools like KadenLive

### 3D Creativity suite
This has its own category because one may or may not want these included due to being graphics intensive. This could include  Blender, ZBrush, Maya

### Development suite
Ranging from terminal based IDEs like NeoVim and Emacs to popular code editors like VS Code and Cursor
